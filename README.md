To use this code you would first need to install node modules, and all other essential libraries.

To use its backend, go to console, go to src folder of this code in console, then cd Backend, then run 'node Backend.js'. This will start the backend server in your local system.
And now you can run this code using npm start.

You can also see its UI (without backend and data) here -> 'https://shrutj.github.io/roxiler_assessment/'. As github only hosts static pages, we cannot use our backend here.
